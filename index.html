                <h2>First Week: New Beginnings</h2>
                <p>The first week of school felt like a whirlwind. There was excitement, but also a strange kind of nervousness. I wasn’t sure how things would unfold. Friendships are delicate, and I couldn’t help but wonder if I’d be able to hold onto the ones that mattered.. Although looking back at it, I've made a lot of good friends along the way - However, I did somehow "lose" one of my great friends. I don't know if "lose" is the right word for expressing such, but all I know is that we aren't holding any conversations anymore. I can't lie, I very much miss her. I didn't just struggle with friends, the whole school year I struggled in maintaining my grades. Every day, there are ups and downs "luckily" I managed to be in between both worlds. To briefly explain the reason behind my failing grades are due to my lack of sleep and procrastination. Most of the time I wonder, if disappointment goes along the way for my parents. I'm very much afraid to lose my specialties, especially the ones that I'm only great at. Although, I'm not aiming for empathy but this is what I personally experienced. A reality check is alright isn't it? but I'm telling you all, being a student is both enjoyable and a challenge. Society must accept the fact that not everyone develops the same intelligence as others. Not just that but it can be affected by many things such as your environment and what state you're in, whether you're experiencing mental struggles or financial struggles. I finished some grade levels as I was fighting depression and mental struggles. And you're probably wondering how was I able to fight it? Well, I'd really like to share how thankful I am for my friends. Because of them, I'm still alive by now. Of course, God led them to help a fellow child of God. I believe so, that's why I'm very thankful for it. Just a reminder that each new day is filled with challenges. Keep fighting and it will pay out. Focus on what's happening now, don't worry about the future and don't grieve about the past.</p>
